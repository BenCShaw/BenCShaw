# Hey, I'm Ben 

I'm a CS student exploring **AI + MLOps**, focused on building a healthcare-centered AI infrastructure while becoming fluent in AI-collaborative coding.

### Current Focus
- Developing foundational skills in ML infrastructure and automation  
- Building out my [AHT Roadmap](https://github.com/BenCShaw/AHT-roadmap)  
- Experimenting inside my [AI Collab Vibe Lab](https://github.com/BenCShaw/ai-collab-vibe-lab)

### Future Goals
- Launch small open-source healthcare AI tools  
- Earn cloud and ML certifications (AWS, GCP)  
- Continue documenting and sharing everything I learn in public
